# HYPERJS
Version 0.0.1

This is a JavaScript Game engine designed for 2D game development. We are still in testing and updating stages of this project, so expect the API to change dramaticaly from version to version. Feel free to give recomendations on anything from API to faster ways to run the code.

We will be having more comprehensable code in future versions, this version works more as a test of ideas. If you want to help out in active development of this project, contact me at http://firenibbler.com/contact
